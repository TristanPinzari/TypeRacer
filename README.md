# React + TypeScript + Vite
After I finished making this website, I wondered whether I could recreate the popular typing game website, Typeracer. Turns out I can.

I replicated the original website's styling and core mechanics: public, private, and practice racetracks. I used React, Node, and Typescript for this project. Notably, this was my first use of Typescript, and it will definitely not be my last, being extremely helpful. For my backend, I used Appwrite for both real-time databasing and functions.

The project is hosted here: [https://tristanpinzari.github.io/TypeRacer/](url)
